Goal of the project
●

Implement an online database for movies,
actors, directors, etc. (Like IMDb.)

●

Display (ﬁxed) information (movie titles,
years, person names, ages, etc.)

●

Visualize user-generated data (history, my
rating of a movie, overall rating of a movie,
etc.)

●

Browse movies, actors, etc.

●

Search for movies, actors, etc.

●

Support bookmarking of items.

●

Allow rating of movies.

●

Keep track of users’ search history.
2

Sources of data
IMDb (The Internet Movie Database)
●

Online database of movies, tv series, actors, directors, etc...

●

The largest, most comprehensive movie database on the web: ~15 million titles, ~12
million persons.

●

Launched in 1990, now owned by Amazon.

●

Smaller, publicly available dataset with ~110.000 movies and ~330.000 persons.

OMDB (The Open Movie Database)
TMDB (The Movie Database)
●

Community-built movie and tv database.

●

Includes additional images of actors and directors.

●

Free online access via public API.

Three portfolio subprojects
●

●

●

Portfolio subproject 1 : Database
○

Design and implement a database

○

Fixed data from IMDB and OMDB

○

Additional structures to support users (signing up, bookmarking, rating, etc.)

○

Provide an API to the backend

Portfolio subproject 2 : Backend (server)
○

Design and implement web services to access and manipulate the database

○

Provide a RESTful web service interface to the frontend

Portfolio subproject 3 : Frontend (client)
○

Design and implement a graphical user interface to the application

○

Access data from TMDB via its API.

which libraries, frameworks, programming
languages they may use, when they fulﬁll
the requirements, etc.)

6

On the content of the reports
●

For each subtask, procedure, functions, class, method,
component, etc: analyze, design, implement, evaluate, and
reﬂect.

●

Avoid being (just) descriptive. Explain, motivate, justify.

●

The report is not diary of activities documenting what you
did when. Present the product, not how you got there.

●

The report is not a list of things (programs, classes, tables,
methods, components, procedures, etc.).

●

Avoid stating what is obvious, common knowledge, or
already given by the requirements.

7

On the (writing) style of the reports
●

Be precise.

●

Be consistent.

●

Be concise.

●

Be formal.

●

Be systematic.

●

Make the report readable.

●

Write in english! Write whole sentences. Use english
spelling and grammar.

●

Use bullets, numbered lists, tables, diagrams, sections, etc.
cleverly.

●

The reports don’t have to be long: don’t add stuff just
because you have that stuff.
8

On the format of the reports
●

Format consistently. A change in format conveys
information.

●

Number all sections.

●

Number all pages.

●

Add a table of contents.

●

Use a monospace font for code.

●

Don’t copy-paste code from an IDE (VSCode, Visual Studio)!

●

Never show screenshots of code!

●

Have many ﬁgures? Put them in appendices.

9

On the process of writing the reports
●

Spend time on the report!

●

Think about the choices you make. (You may diverge from
these suggestions, but at least make an informed choice.)

●

Don’t write the report shortly before deadline.

●

Write the report iteratively: Draft a section or paragraph,
then revise and reﬁne it. Let other group members review
a what you wrote.

●

Proofread for grammar, spelling, and formatting errors. Use
a spell checker.

●

(Read or skim the set of requirements for all three portfolio
projects before getting started on the ﬁrst.)
